<li> Air at 1 atm and 20 degree C flows through a packed bed. The diameter of a sphere in the bed is 1 mm and the density of it is 2.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The bed porosity is 0.4. The diameter of the bed 2.75m and the height is 2.75m.The viscosity of the air is 1.81*10<sup>-5</sup>. Find the minimum fluidization velocity and the minimum fluidization mass flow rate.</li>

<li>From literature, collect information on applications of fluidized bed in chemical engineering processes.</li>
